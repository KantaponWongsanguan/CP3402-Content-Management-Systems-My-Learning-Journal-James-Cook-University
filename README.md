## Assignment CP3402 - Assignment 1 - Startup
### Assignment Activities
The assignment activities started with learning the basic steps for using both WordPress and Joomla 5 CMS through various sources provided by the lecturer and on the learning platform, YouTube. Then I began with conceptualizing ideas for my startup websites which aligns with my interest, in sport and interior design. Then I drafted website content, design structure, and target audience identification accordingly. 
I chose WordPress and Joomla 5 since the lecturer recommended it. This was a great decision, since the next assignment will be done using WordPress giving me an early understanding of its respective features, and Joomla 5 to understand the availability of plugins/extensions, features, scalability, and community support in the different CMS. 
Finally, I maintained a consistent structure, layout, and navigation between WordPress and Joomla. Incorporate various media types like text, images, and videos to enhance user engagement, and include at least one additional plugin or extension beyond the base installation in each CMS to demonstrate their customization capabilities.
Overall, by completing this assignment using WordPress and Joomla, I gained a comprehensive, more or less, understanding of two different CMSs while simultaneously developing functional and engaging websites for the startup venture.
