# LearningJournal-CP3402-JCU
## Week 1 
### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I started with attempts to set up Web hosting services from the given list of resources. Unfortunately, the free SiteGround offer has been used up for the CP1406 in the previous term, I decided to set up repositories for weekly learning journals and web hosting for a static simple website for this week's practical. However, I have to take note that, for any upcoming practical assignments where database and/or PHP are required, I may have to set up an additional account for the appropriate web hosting service.
Moreover, I have installed and set up GitHub Desktop to the repositories for future use with VSC. In addition, as suggested in Prac 1 - Basic Web Design, I have installed and set up the required applications, Vagrant, Docker, etc., and also, set up accounts for Slack and Trello.

### Estimated Hours
4 hours (likely to continue over the weekend to play around with GitHub & bootstrap & other suggested web hostings in advance)

### Content Insights
I have gained insights by successfully configuring GitHub Desktop for repository management and initiating setups for version control in Visual Studio Code (VSC). By installing necessary applications such as Vagrant and Docker, I have realized there is still much to learn and be learned from these new tools. Moreover, going through the process of creating and using a simple basic website, has given me a chance to remember and relearn HTML and CSS styling which has been over a year since I last used them. This will certainly prove to be a valuable experience as I continue studying under this CP3402 module.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The focus this week was on foundational setup and tool familiarization for establishing a baseline for future development tasks. A noteworthy insight I have gained was that understanding tools matters. Getting the hang of various tools basic, e.g. GitHub Desktop, VSC, bootstrap, and other CSS frameworks is key for managing my work well within this department. Lastly setting up Slack and Trello will definitely help when working with others later on.
