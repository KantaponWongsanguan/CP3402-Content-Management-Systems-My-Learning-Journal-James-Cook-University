# LearningJournal-CP3402-JCU
## Week 1 
### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I started with attempts to set up Web hosting services from the given list of resources. Unfortunately, the free SiteGround offer has been used up for the CP1406 in the previous term, I decided to set up repositories for weekly learning journals and web hosting for a static simple website for this week's practical. However, I have to take note that, for any upcoming practical assignments where database and/or PHP are required, I may have to set up an additional account for the appropriate web hosting service.
Moreover, I have installed and set up GitHub Desktop to the repositories for future use with VSC. In addition, as suggested in Prac 1 - Basic Web Design, I have installed and set up the required applications, Vagrant, Docker, etc., and also, set up accounts for Slack and Trello.

### Estimated Hours
4 hours (likely to continue over the weekend to play around with GitHub & bootstrap & other suggested web hostings in advance)

### Content Insights
I have gained insights by successfully configuring GitHub Desktop for repository management and initiating setups for version control in Visual Studio Code (VSC). By installing necessary applications such as Vagrant and Docker, I have realized there is still much to learn and be learned from these new tools. Moreover, going through the process of creating and using a simple basic website, has given me a chance to remember and relearn HTML and CSS styling which has been over a year since I last used them. This will certainly prove to be a valuable experience as I continue studying under this CP3402 module.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The focus this week was on foundational setup and tool familiarization for establishing a baseline for future development tasks. A noteworthy insight I have gained was that understanding tools matters. Getting the hang of various tools basic, e.g. GitHub Desktop, VSC, bootstrap, and other CSS frameworks is key for managing my work well within this department. Lastly setting up Slack and Trello will definitely help when working with others later on.

## Assignment CP3402 - Assignment 1 - Startup
### Assignment Activities
The assignment activities started with learning the basic steps for using both WordPress and Joomla 5 CMS through various sources provided by the lecturer and on the learning platform, YouTube. Then I began with conceptualizing ideas for my startup websites which aligns with my interest, in sport and interior design. Then I drafted website content, design structure, and target audience identification accordingly. 
I chose WordPress and Joomla 5 since the lecturer recommended it. This was a great decision, since the next assignment will be done using WordPress giving me an early understanding of its respective features, and Joomla 5 to understand the availability of plugins/extensions, features, scalability, and community support in the different CMS. 
Finally, I maintained a consistent structure, layout, and navigation between WordPress and Joomla. Incorporate various media types like text, images, and videos to enhance user engagement, and include at least one additional plugin or extension beyond the base installation in each CMS to demonstrate their customization capabilities.
Overall, by completing this assignment using WordPress and Joomla, I gained a comprehensive, more or less, understanding of two different CMSs while simultaneously developing functional and engaging websites for the startup venture.

### Estimated Hours
7 hours not including time spent during weekly lectures and practicals. 

### Content Insights
There are a few content insights I found during the time I spent on this assignment. In the process of developing two websites for this startup project, the process started with selecting distinctive business concepts and identifying the target audience while underscoring the importance of aligning my ideas with the intended market. 
The rules set with utilizing a minimum of two different content management systems was a key learning point for me. It allows me to understand the diverse platforms from the beginner entry to more or less a comprehensive understanding level. As the websites continued to take shape, maintaining intended structures while integrating varieties of plugins and media types was quite a crucial aspect since it emphasized the significance of engaging content with the flow of interest on the website through content.
Testing the UX highlighted the need for mobile-friendly interfaces which marks the important aspects of utilizing CMSs since, in the previous module, CP1406 Web Design and Development, the primary focus was on developing an efficient HTML and CSS code but, as said, utilizing CMSs done it all more easily. The same can be said for intuitive navigation and accessibility features. 
Additionally, ensuring consistent branding elements across both websites illuminated the importance of visual identity in brand representation.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By building two different websites using WordPress and Joomla, I learned that it isn't just about creating web pages—it's a chance to learn some cool stuff with efficiency, different than crafting HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, etc. I get to become better at using these special website tools, which can open doors to jobs where I can utilize them to make websites. Overall, it's like learning how to build two kinds of houses. 
In addition, I also learned how to make websites that people like to use with consideration of UX in mind. Lastly, I experienced the process of extensively exploring the community where people have made their remarks and shared in the form of great plug-ins and extensions to this CMS community, hence, I got to look up various interesting plug-ins that make CMSs even better.


## Week 4
### Learning Activities & Resources
The learning activities this week were that in the material courses, the activities are that learning how to make websites that speak directly to people online. Kinda like building a house: starting by understanding what the people who'll visit want and need. Then, organize the important stuff and test out different layouts before finally creating and launching your site. Also discovering how to keep track of changes you make along the way, just like keeping a diary of all your work. Plus, there's a special lesson on moving websites from one place to another which taught how to import and export either templates or full websites.

### Practical Screenshot Description
1. XAMPP Control Panel - The first Screenshot shows a running status [greenbar] on both Apache and MySQL. At first, I encountered a problem where I could not start MYSQL. I was able to solve this problem by checking the error Logs by clicking the "Logs" button next to the "Config" button. It showed that, in my running task I already have other MySQL running on Port 3306 due to the JCU learning module CP2404 Database Modelling also used the MySQL program. After stopping mySQL task in the background I was able to start running MySQL on the newly installed XAMPP.
2. localhost/phpmyadmid/ - The second Screenshot shows a running localhost/php in admin interface. This represents a running XAMPP local host on my device. Additionally, I have also created a new database called 'newdb' which shows on the list of databases on the left side panel
3. localhost/wordpress-6.4.4/ - The third Screenshot shows that I have installed WordPress-6.4.4 successfully on my device, integrating it with the XAMPP local host.
4. localhost/phpmyadmin/ - THis last Screenshot shows a working WordPress that has been linked to newly created database, 'newdb', which shows a table of structured database within the WordPress site. This represents that my wordpress-6.4.4 which I have installed on my XAMPP local host has been properly configured with the new database. Hence, I now have a running localhost, web service, and a running  db within my device.
