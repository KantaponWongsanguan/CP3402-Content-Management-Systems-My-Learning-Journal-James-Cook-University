# LearningJournal-CP3402-JCU
## Week 1 
### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I started with attempts to set up Web hosting services from the given list of resources. Unfortunately, the free SiteGround offer has been used up for the CP1406 in the previous term, I decided to set up repositories for weekly learning journals and web hosting for a static simple website for this week's practical. However, I have to take note that, for any upcoming practical assignments where database and/or PHP are required, I may have to set up an additional account for the appropriate web hosting service.
Moreover, I have installed and set up GitHub Desktop to the repositories for future use with VSC. In addition, as suggested in Prac 1 - Basic Web Design, I have installed and set up the required applications, Vagrant, Docker, etc., and also, set up accounts for Slack and Trello.

### Estimated Hours
4 hours (likely to continue over the weekend to play around with GitHub & bootstrap & other suggested web hostings in advance)

### Content Insights
I have gained insights by successfully configuring GitHub Desktop for repository management and initiating setups for version control in Visual Studio Code (VSC). By installing necessary applications such as Vagrant and Docker, I have realized there is still much to learn and be learned from these new tools. Moreover, going through the process of creating and using a simple basic website, has given me a chance to remember and relearn HTML and CSS styling which has been over a year since I last used them. This will certainly prove to be a valuable experience as I continue studying under this CP3402 module.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The focus this week was on foundational setup and tool familiarization for establishing a baseline for future development tasks. A noteworthy insight I have gained was that understanding tools matters. Getting the hang of various tools basic, e.g. GitHub Desktop, VSC, bootstrap, and other CSS frameworks is key for managing my work well within this department. Lastly setting up Slack and Trello will definitely help when working with others later on.

### Estimated Hours
The estimated hours for this week are about 3 hours in total. Inc, WordPress, Joomla, and LinkedIn videos

### Content Insights
The LearnJcu material dives into dynamic websites, highlighting their customizable nature but noting the extra server software needed compared to static HTML sites. This outlines creating custom dynamic sites, stressing the importance of programming elements and the time-saving benefits of existing solutions. Content Management Systems (CMSs) are introduced as powerful tools for content management, offering more functionality but requiring additional resources. Emphasizing the trade-offs between custom development and CMSs, considering functionality and technical aspects in website creation.
Moreover, the learnings on LinkedIn on WordPress were how to install WordPress, Create posts and pages, Format text, publish and schedule posts, and more. Basically, introduction to how to utilize WordPress at the entry-level.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The information shows me, the key areas that may be involved in my career growth, I may need to develop robust technical skills like database programming and interactive feature implementation for custom dynamic websites and understand popular Content Management Systems (CMSs) such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal can significantly bolster my employability, particularly in roles involving website management or content creation. I also need to be able to recognize the trade-offs between custom development and CMS utilization which is crucial for informed decision-making in various project scenarios, showcasing adaptability and learning agility in the future. 
Moreover, the hands-on experience through provided demos and resources including the weekly practical enhances practical knowledge and gives insights into collaborative workflow management which I think, is a vital skill in professional settings. 
Overall, this knowledge helps me with technical expertise, decision-making insights, and practical experience which is essential for me if I decide to enter a career in web development or content management.
